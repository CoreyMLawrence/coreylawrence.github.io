        <h2>Corey's Unique Journey</h2>
        <p>
          My journey into software engineering is a bit unconventional. I
          started in marketing, learning how to connect with people, understand
          their needs, and make brands truly stand out. One of my proudest
          achievements was growing organic search traffic by 300% through SEO
          and a website overhaul, but what really struck me was how deeply I
          cared about the mechanics behind these technologies. I wanted to go
          beyond simply shaping online environments; I wanted to build them.
        </p>
        <h3>From Marketing to Full-Stack Development</h3>
        <p>
          In my first marketing role, I handled everything from product design
          to web presence. Along the way, I discovered a passion for coding,
          realizing that understanding what customers needed was invaluable in
          creating solutions that genuinely met their needs. This realization
          drove me to pursue a computer science degree four years ago, immersing
          myself in the technical side while still holding onto my marketing
          insights. This blend has turned out to be my edge, especially in my
          role today at Phonelo AI, where I bring both customer perspective and
          technical expertise to every project.
        </p>
        <h3>Building Experiences, Not Just Software</h3>
        <p>
          With a background in React, TypeScript, and full-stack development, I
          don’t just code—I create experiences. My aim isn’t to build technology
          for its own sake but to craft solutions that make people’s lives
          easier and help businesses thrive. I approach each project with a mix
          of empathy and technical understanding, ensuring that every
          interaction feels intentional, each feature meets real user needs, and
          that it all carries a touch of humanity that can’t be replicated.
        </p>
        <h3>Connecting Technical Skill with Customer Insight</h3>
        <p>
          Bridging these two worlds—technical skill and user empathy—has been my
          focus. Whether it’s designing intuitive dashboards, integrating AI
          features that anticipate user needs, or enhancing performance to make
          each interaction seamless, my goal is to create digital products that
          connect with users on a deeper level while achieving business
          objectives. In a world where AI can replicate almost anything, I
          believe it's the originality, the “human” side, that makes tech truly
          meaningful.
        </p>
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>
          I’m committed to bringing creativity and dedication to every project,
          crafting solutions that go beyond functionality to make a real
          difference for those who use them. By blending my understanding of
          user needs with technical skill, I aim to ensure each interaction
          isn’t just effective but truly meets users where they are, addressing
          their challenges and enhancing their experiences. My goal is to
          contribute not just as an engineer but as someone who brings heart and
          impact to every digital experience.
